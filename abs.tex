With the increasing use of the Internet, malicious software has more frequently been designed to take control of users computers for illicit purposes. Cybercriminals are putting a lot of efforts to make malware difficult to detect. In this research, we demonstrate how the Metamorphic JavaScript Malware can effect a victim's machine using a malicious or compromised Firefox add-on. Following the same methodology, we develop another add-on with malware static detection technique to detect Metamorphic JavaScript Malware.
