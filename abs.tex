With the increasing use of the Internet, malicious software has more frequently been designed to take control of users computers for illicit purposes. Cybercriminals are putting a lot of efforts to make malware difficult to detect. In this study, we demonstrate how the metamorphic JavaScript malware can effect a victim's machine using a malicious or compromised Firefox add-on. Following the same methodology, we develop another add-on with malware static detection technique to detect metamorphic JavaScript malware.
