\chapter{Introduction}

\LaTeX\ can be viewed
as a compiled programming language, in contrast to that 
nightmare known as Microsoft Word,
which can be viewed as an interpreted language. So, to typeset a
document in \LaTeX, you create a text file that has the {\tt .tex} extension.
This file includes some special
commands, known as macros. Then
you compile your {\tt .tex} file by running  \LaTeX,
which produces your typeset document, as a pdf. 

In this paper, a few basics are discussed. There are plenty of good online resource
if you need help with more advanced topics.


\section{Problem} 

To typeset text, you type whatever you want. Multiple spaces are
ignored                           when typesetting, and
the end of a line is treated as another space.
Consequently, when you are typing, you can break lines anywhere, like here
or here,
since the lines are formatted automatically when you typeset the document.
You start a new paragraph by leaving a blank line.

See how easy it is to start a new paragraph? A blank line does the trick.


\section{Proposed Solution}

Typesetting text is generally pretty easy. However, there are some special
characters that will not be typeset as you might expect. In the remainder of this
section we consider some of the most common of these
special characters. 

The backslash ``\verb+\+'' is used 
as the ``escape'' character, meaning that
whatever follows a backslash is interpreted as a macro.
For example, when \verb+\LaTeX+ is typeset, it looks like \LaTeX, which 
is a lot different from LaTeX.

To get double quotes, use two single quotes. That is, the left double quote is ``, while the right double
quote is ''. When you do it correctly, quoted text looks ``like this.''
If you use the double quote key, you will always get right-quotes, which looks "like this," and is
almost certainly not what you want.

A tilde ``\verb+~+'' is used as a ``tie,'' that is, a space is inserted, but no line break can occur.
For example, you might type Dr.~Stamp just to be sure that the line of text
does not break between Dr. and Stamp, as it otherwise might.

The percent sign is used for comments---everything following a percent sign 
on a given line is ignored when you \LaTeX\ your file. % Like this stuff here
If you want a percent sign to appear in your document, use \verb+\%+, 
which will give you this \%.

The dollar sign also has special meaning, since it is used to start and end
math formulas. To typeset a dollar sign, use \verb+\$+, like this~\$.

To force \LaTeX\ to insert a space, use a backslash followed by
a space, that is, \verb+\ +. You can put in multiple extra spaces\ \ \ \ \ \ \ if you want.

\section{Why my approach is good?}

To change fonts, enclose the text in curly brackets and give the appropriate font command.
For example, to italicize text, {\it do this}, and to get boldface, {\bf this is the ticket}.
Another useful font is {\tt this one}, which produces a typewriter-like font.
